## File extension

```We no longer live in a 8.3 world, so we should be using the most descriptive file extensions. It’s sad that all our operating systems rely on this stupid convention instead of the better creator code or a metadata model, but great that they now support longer file extensions.```–Hilton Lipschitz ([via](http://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/07/the-markdown-file-extension/))

```"…the only file extension I would endorse is “.markdown”, for the same reason offered by Hilton Lipschitz:"```–John Gruber, creator of Markdown ([via](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/01/08/markdown-extension))
